# DataWarehouse Snowflake GIT repo

The aim of this repository is to fully manage our new shiny Snowflake instance. 

## What is this repository for?

This repository acts as the main source of truth for Snowflake based data model. It consist of model DDL scripts (in `model` folder) and deployment scripts (in `scripts` folder).

<a name="installation"></a>
## Installation

#### 1. Python

Make sure that `python3` executable is present in your path:

```sh
$ python3
Python 3.7.7 (default, Mar 10 2020, 15:43:33)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.17)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

Deployment script won't work with Python2!

#### 2. Install python dependencies

This should be as easy as running:

```sh
$ python3 -m pip install -r script/requirements.txt
```

Of course you can use `pip` instead, but this way it easier to make sure the packages will be installed in a proper location.

Feel free to use one of Python's environment managers.

#### 3. Setup Snowflake connection

Current version supports [Key Pair Authentication](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/python-connector-example.html#using-key-pair-authentication) with Snowflake. Only unencrypted keys are supported! There is an undocumented username+password method but should not be used.

If you have your key pair already generated you can jump to section **3b**.

##### 3a. Generate key pair

Generate unencrypted private key:

```sh
$ openssl genrsa 2048 | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -out [username]_snowflake.p8 -nocrypt
```

Now generate the public key by referencing the private key:

```sh
$ openssl rsa -in [username]_snowflake.p8 -pubout -out [username]_snowflake.pub
```

Assign the public key to the Snowflake user using ALTER USER. Run the query using your Snowflake's client:

```sql
alter user [username] set rsa_public_key='MIIBIjANBgkqh...';
```

To fill in the `rsa_public_key` part you have to copy `[username]_snowflake.pub` file contents and paste it in SQL console.

**Note:** You have to remove `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----` and `-----END PUBLIC KEY-----` lines from public key in your SQL query.

Now place your keys in a safe location. For Linux and OSX this can be for example:

```sh
$ mv [username]_snowflake.* ~/.ssh/
```

##### 3b. Create a configuration file

Copy `conn.ini-sample` file to `.conn.ini` and fill it in:

```sh
$ cp script/conn.ini-sample .conn.ini
$ edit .conn.ini
```

In the `.conn.ini` file you have to fill in at least two fields: `user` and `private_key`.

Don't worry. The `.conn.ini` file won't be added to the repository (it's included in `.gitignore`).

<a name="actions"></a>
### Actions

<a name="abandoned"></a>
#### `abandoned`

Compares active development branches and database clones. It does so by querying all the databases `LIKE '_DEV%'` in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.DATABASES`. For each clone found it is searching for a corresponding branch.

<a name="branch-clone-mapping"></a>Branch names are converted to database clone names this way:

1. Uppercase
2. Replace all non-words characters (`\W`) with underscore (`_`)
3. Take first 30 chars
4. Add prefix `_DEV_`

This way branch `feature/DW-1249-create-pre-deploy-and-post-deploy-tests` is mapped to `_DEV_FEATURE_DW_1249_CREATE_PRE_DEP`.

**`abandoned` example output:**

```
|____________clone_____________|_____created______|_____updated______|_has branch?__|
| _DEV_DW_1336_CREATE_A_SAMPLE | 2020-04-20 17:18 | 2020-04-20 17:19 |      no      |
| _DEV_FEATURE_A               | 2020-04-22 12:04 | 2020-04-22 12:06 |      no      |
| _DEV_FEATURE_SQL_QUERIES_IN_ | 2020-04-23 19:27 | 2020-04-23 19:29 |      no      |
| _DEV_FEATURE_DW_1249_CREATE_ | 2020-04-24 23:13 | 2020-04-24 23:14 |     yes      |
```

Database clones with `no` in the last column (`has branch?`) should be dropped.

<a name="clone"></a>
#### `clone`

Clones (or replaces) database based on production. New clone is created based on active branch name (see [branch to clone mapping](#branch-clone-mapping) in [abandoned](#abandoned) action to learn how branch name is mapped to clone name). Due to this it is impossible to run `clone` on main branch (**CICD** will refuse to run).

If target clone does not exist the action will perform immediately. If target clone exists **CICD** will ask for confirmation before running. This behavior can be overwritten by `--force` flag.

**`clone` example output:**

```
Checking if _DEV_FEATURE_A already exists...
_DEV_FEATURE_A already exists. Are you sure you want to replace it (y/n): y
Cloning DWH into _DEV_FEATURE_A
Cloning finished
```

Example run on `main` branch:
```
Trying to create new database with name dwh...
```

<a name="compare"></a>
#### `compare`

Compare allows you to list all the objects modified in your cloned database since cloning. The comparison is made purely on a database level. Even if altered an object manually on the server (ignoring GIT and releases history table) the object will be listed.

Technically compare list all the objects from `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.`[TABLES|FUNCTIONS|FILE_FORMATS|EXTERNAL_TABLES|PIPES|PROCEDURES|SEQUENCES|STAGES|VIEWS]` looking for those with `LAST_ALTERED` greater than current clone creation time (+1 minute).

Comparison algorithm assumes the object was changed in both situation: it's definition has changed or it contents has changed (in case of a table).

**`compare` example output:**

```
|___schema___|__________object name___________|____type____|___last change____|
|     PUBLIC . dwh_releases_history           |   TABLE    | 2020-04-12 15:42 |
|        RAW . lnk_event_sess                 |   TABLE    | 2020-04-12 15:42 |
|        RAW . hub_event                      |   TABLE    | 2020-04-12 15:42 |
|         DM . dim_page                       |    VIEW    | 2020-04-12 15:42 |
|        RAW . load_hub_session               | PROCEDURE  | 2020-04-12 15:42 |
|        BIZ . sat_event                      |    VIEW    | 2020-04-12 15:42 |
```

In the example above all the listed objects were somehow altered after the clone was created. All the (beside `dwh_releases_history`) should be included in release file.

<a name="deploy"></a>
#### `deploy`

Deploys changes from release candidate file.

<a name="diff"></a>
#### `diff`

Show all the changes in `model` folder between current branch and `main`. Technically it runs:

```
$ git diff --color=always main model
```

**`diff` example output:**

```diff
diff --git a/model/DV_Layers/dm/Dimension/tables/dim_time.sql b/model/DV_Layers/dm/Dimension/tables/dim_time.sql
index c9a758c..3303895 100644
@@ -2,7 +2,7 @@ CREATE TABLE dm.dim_time

-       hour_of_day varchar(2) NOT NULL,
+       hour_of_day varchar(4) NOT NULL,
        minute_of_hour varchar(2) NOT NULL
```

<a name="history"></a>
#### `history`

This action displays a comparison of all the releases applied in on clone and production. It works only on a database level. Use [diff](#diff) action if you want to see the comparison on GIT level.

Technically the comparison is done by comparing entries in tables `PUBLIC.DWH_RELEASES_HISTORY` both in the production database, and cloned database.

**`history` example output:**

```
|_commit hash_|___________file name____________|__applied by__|____applied on____|branch|_prod_|

```

In the example above we can see that:

1. Release file named `releases/dim_page.sql` was applied only in our branch. Most likely this is something we did in our branch.
2. Release file named `releases/fact_visits.sql` was applied on production but not applied in our clone. There are two possible ways of syncing with production:
  a. Faster: apply this missing release file by running [sync](#sync) action.
  b. Safer: run [clone](#clone) again to get a fresh copy of production.


<a name="migrate"></a>
#### `migrate`

This is an equivalent of:

```sh
$ ./cicd.sh prepare deploy
```

In other words it prepares `releases/release_candidate.sql` file first, and then releases it. This can work only if you are making safe changes (as described in [prepare](#prepare) action).

<a name="prepare"></a>
#### `prepare`

Prepares release candidate file. Let's assume we are on a branch `feature/a` and we already [cloned](#clone) database into `_DEV_FEATURE_A` (as described in [branch to clone mapping](#branchclonemapping)). Prepare works this way:

1. Getting latest applied commit in a current clone. It's as simple as selecting the latest `COMMIT` from `_DEV_FEATURE_A.PUBLIC.DWH_RELEASES_HISTORY`.
2. Getting all the modified (renamed, removed, added) files in `model` folder. These files were not yet applied on current clone.
3. Creating the file: `releases/release_candidate.sql`. This file has a recipe on how to apply changes on clone. Additionally `releases/release_candidate.sha` file is created with `release_candidate.sql` checksum inside.

`release_candidate.sql` file contains entries in this form:

```SQL
--.Release candidate file, branch: feature_a

--.File was changed but *will not be* included in the release.
-- [M] NOT_INCLUDED:model/DV_Layers/dm/Dimension/tables/dim_time.sql
--.DIFF: @@ -5 +5 @@ CREATE TABLE dm.dim_time
--.DIFF: -	hour_of_day varchar(2) NOT NULL,
--.DIFF: +	hour_of_day varchar(3) NOT NULL,

   You may need to include an ALTER TABLE statement to properly sync database state:
   ALTER TABLE DM.DIM_TIME <<HERE>>;

--.File was changed and will be included in the release.
--.You can change the order of the INCLUDE: statement below.
-- [M] INCLUDED:model/DV_Layers/dm/Dimension/views/dim_event_la.sql
```

As you can see each modified (renamed, removed, added) leaves an entry in `release_candidate.sql`. There are two main types of entries:

<a name="safe-changes"></a>
##### Safe changes

Safe changes are those that can be applied without any additional attention. These are:

* newly created files
* modified files with objects other that tables and streams

You can easily notice that view `dim_event_la.sql` is a safe change. Updated view definition can be easily applied on the server. There are two easy ways of detecting safe changes:

1. By looking at `INCLUDED:` keyword in file description line
2. By having no non-comment lines below the entry. Notice that there is nothing below `[M] INCLUDED:model/.../dim_event_la.sql`

In most of the cases you don't have to do anything with this entries. Exceptions are:

1. This is a table or stream object definition that you already added into production database.

    In this case you should change keyword `INCLUDE` to `NOT_INCLUDE` to avoid table/stream definition being executed. 
2. The order or `INCLUDE` statements is wrong.

    In this case you shoud reorder the entries accordingly. You have to be careful with lines with filenames. Those starting from `--.` are comments that can be ignored.

<a name="unsafe-changes"></a>
##### Unsafe changes

Unsafe changes are:

* modified or renamed files with table or stream definition
* removed files with objects of any type definition

You can easily notice that table `dim_time.sql` is **not** a safe change. Updated table definition can not be easily applied on the server. You have to prepare a proper `ALTER TABLE` statement. There are two easy ways of detecting unsafe changes:

1. By looking at `NON_INCLUDED:` keyword in file description line
2. By having a non-comment lines below the entry. Notice the sentences below `[M] INCLUDED:model/.../dim_time.sql`

Your job here is to replace the suggestion and sample code generated by **CICD** and fill it in with a valid SQL statement (if necessary). In the example above we should replace:

```sql
   You may need to include an ALTER TABLE statement to properly sync database state:
   ALTER TABLE DM.DIM_TIME <<HERE>>;
```
with:
```sql
ALTER TABLE DM.DIM_TIME CHANGE hour_of_day hour_of_day varchar(3) NOT NULL;
```

To make this process easier you have a difference highlighted. Notice lines starting from `--.DIFF:`

```diff
@@ -5 +5 @@ CREATE TABLE dm.dim_time
-	hour_of_day varchar(2) NOT NULL,
+	hour_of_day varchar(3) NOT NULL,
```

<a name="sync"></a>
#### `sync`

Sync performs all the missing releases in `releases` folder and run them against the database. It is somehow similar to `prepare` but it scans `releases` folder (with already prepared releases) instead of raw `model` folder.

Syncing can be necessary if you merge changes from other branch (including `main`) into your branch. Imagine this scenario:

1. You branched out to `feature/a` and created already a release file `releases/feature_a.sql`.
2. Other person was working on a `feature/b`, created `releases/feature_b.sql` and merge it to `main`.
3. You decided to `git merge` before creating a pull request. This created `releases/feature_b.sql` in your repository. You have two options (as described in [history](#history) action):
  a. Faster: apply this missing release file by running [sync](#sync) action.
  b. Safer: run [clone](#clone) again to get a fresh copy of production.

**`sync` example output:**

```
  [A] releases/feature_DW-1249-create-pre-deploy-and-post-deploy-tests.sql
Syncing changes:
Running release file releases/feature_DW-1249-create-pre-deploy-and-post-deploy-tests.sql:
   'DWH_RELEASES_HISTORY was sucesfully created',
New entry in release history table with d31197261424b6c96ae7b8d31fcc1ac9220f934b
```

<a name="test_sync"></a>
#### `test_sync`

Test sync combines three operations in one action:

1. Creates a fresh clone of production database. This clone has a new name made out last commit SHA, not branch name. This way it's independent from all you existing changes.
2. Syncs all the unsynchronized releases in `releases` directory.
3. Drops clone created in step 1.

This step is useful for testing your changes before creating a pull-request. It ensures your release file is deployable on production.

**`test_sync` example output:**

```
Cloning DWH into _DEV_26FC3058369ACECB30C48A9C69FB47
Cloning finished
   [A] releases/feature_DW-1249-create-pre-deploy-and-post-deploy-tests.sql
Syncing changes:

```

#### Optional arguments

##### `--help`

Displays help message. Running `./cicd.sh` without arguments will also cause the script to show help.

<a name="verbose"></a>
##### `--verbose`

Use `--verbose` or `-v` to display more details. It enables debugging messages and print-outs all the SQL queries being raised against Snowflake.

##### `--dry-run`

Use `--dry-run` or `-t` with [deploy](#deploy) or [sync](#sync) actions to preview the release SQL to be performed. Has no impact on other actions.

##### `--force`

Use `--force` or `-f` to:

1. Ignore question _Clone already exists. Are you sure you want to replace it_ while running [clone](#clone) action.
2. Bypass error _releases/release_candidate.sql was changed or you changed branch, can't create new release candidate._ In this case it the file will be overwritten.

<a name="work-cycle"></a>
### Work cycle

#### 1. Create branch

Start from branching out from main branch. It's usually `main` but it doesn't have to. You can branch out from other active branch.

You can branch-out using Jira, Bitbucket or command line. In all the examples below we are going to use command line and we are going to work on branch `feature/a`.

```sh
# checking active branch
$ git status
On branch main
[...]
# making sure we have all the latest changes
$ git pull
# branching out
$ git checkout -b feature/a
```

#### 2. Clone database

We have a branch to work on. Now we need a fresh clone of production to have a safe destination of all our changes.

Clone database into new `_DEV_FEATURE_A` with:

```sh
$ ./cicd.sh clone
```

(read more about [cloning](#clone))

Now we have a new branch `feature/a` and new development clone `_DEV_FEATURE_A`. Both equal to production.

#### 3. Modify and deploy changes

Work on files in the `model/` folder and [migrate](#migrate) all the changes with:

```sh
$ ./cicd.sh migrate
```

[Migrate](#migrate) is actually running two tasks: [prepare](#prepare) followed by [deploy](#deploy). The second step can raise an error if you made an [unsafe change](#unsafe-changes). It usually happens the moment you changed table or stream, or you dropped a file from `model` folder.

In this case the script raises an error:

```
Code placeholder (<<HERE>>) found in the release candidate file.
```

You have to manually change the `releases/release_candidate.sql` file as described in [unsafe changes](#unsafe-changes) section. Once done you can repeat the second step with:

```sh
$ ./cicd.sh deploy
```

You should notice that while you modify files in `model` folder and deploy your changes in your clone, there is a new file being updated after each action. It's `releases/feature_a.sql` file. This file holds all the changes you've made.

#### 4. Check your changes

You are give three ways to check your changes. Let's start from source code level.

To preview detailed [diff](#diff) of your branch against production run:

```sh
$ ./cicd.sh diff
```

You can also compare all the releases applied on your clone and compare the with production by running [history](#history) action:

```sh
$ ./cicd.sh history
```

The last option to examine your changes is it preview all the objects definitions changed in your cloned database since it's creation. To do so run [compare](#compare):

```sh
$ ./cicd.sh compare
```

#### 5. Test your changes

Before submitting a pull-request test your changes against a fresh copy of your database. There is a command that automates all the steps. It [test_sync](#test_sync):

```sh
$ ./cicd.sh test_sync
```

If it's all good you are ready to create a pull-request!

<a name="#use-cases"></a>
### Use cases

#### 1. Changing object definition

All situations in which you modify an object DDL. This including renaming the object (and a corresponding file).

##### a) [safe changes](#safe-changes)

This is the simplest scenario. Open any `.sql` file under `model/` folder and perform changes. Then run:

```sh
$ ./cicd.sh migrate
```

The script will detect the change and reapply it on the server. 

##### b) [unsafe changes](#unsafe-changes)

Change table or stream definition in the `model/` folder and commit you changes. Then run:

```sh
$ ./cicd.sh prepare
```

Open the `releases/release_candidate.sql` file. You will notice that the changed table is listed in the release_candidate text, and you have to manually add a proper `ALTER TABLE` SQL statement.

Once done run:

```sh
$ ./cicd.sh deploy
```

#### 2. Adding a new object

It's as simple as adding a new file into `model/` folder and running:

```sh
$ ./cicd.sh migrate
```

This works regardless the type of new object.

#### 3. Dropping an object

Remove a file from the `model/` folder and commit you changes. Then run:

```sh
$ ./cicd.sh prepare
```

Open the `releases/release_candidate.sql` file. You will notice that the dropped file is listed in the release_candidate text, and you have to manually add a proper `DROP OBJECT` SQL statement.

Once done run:

```sh
$ ./cicd.sh deploy
```

#### 4. Altering a database state

All the other SQL statements that are not tracked in the `model/` folder can be also applied and tracked. To do so simply run:

```sh
$ ./cicd.sh prepare
```

This will generate an empty `releases/release_candidate.sql` file. Open it and add any SQL code you like.

Once done run:

```sh
$ ./cicd.sh deploy
```

<a name="#how-it-works"></a>
## How it works

It's explained partially in the [Actions](#actions) section.

<a name="#troubleshooting"></a>
## Troubleshooting

In most of the situations **CICD** is not leaving you alone. It explains what went wrong and what you can do about it.

For example if you start working on `model` folder before cloning, script will suggest you doing so the moment you run [prepare](#prepare) for the first time.

If your deployment script failed, the script will print out the exact SQL statement that failed, allow you to fix it and [deploy](#deploy) again.

In other cases adding [--verbose](#verbose) can be useful.
